            <p>We've always wanted to build something together. Well, this should be the first of hopefully many such somethings.</p>

            <p>Feel free to start adding, removing, changing things. Whatever you feel like. What I hope to have one day is a repository of all that we have done together, the places we have seen and hopefully, the ideas we will work on.</p>

            <p>PS : At the moment the repo needs to be public for this to work, so don't start adding personal data or photos. We will have to sit and workshop this to move the domain to a proper place eventually. Attention to detail has never been my thing :D</p>
